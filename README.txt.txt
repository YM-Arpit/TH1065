One-Page Summary of Prototype

This prototype is designed to enable efficient management, safety, and visibility during Simhastha 2028, one of the largest human gatherings in the world. The system integrates IoT-based telematics hardware, cloud analytics, and real-time dashboards to track people, vehicles, and emergency assets. It ensures faster emergency response, better situational awareness, and scalable deployment across thousands of event zones. Beyond the event, the solution is reusable for civic management and other large gatherings.

Key Features & Functionalities

Safety Monitoring → Real-time alerts and emergency response support.

Crowd & Fleet Visibility → Live tracking of people movement, vehicles, and critical assets.

Scalability → Supports thousands of units across multiple event locations.

Predictive Preparedness → AI-driven insights for crowd flow and fleet management.

Reusability → Long-term deployment for future events and civic use cases.

Core Problem Being Addressed

Managing millions of devotees at Simhastha 2028 requires a scalable system for safety, control, and emergency readiness. Current methods are manual, reactive, and lack visibility. Our prototype directly addresses this gap with real-time monitoring, predictive intelligence, and integrated response mechanisms.

Clear Overview of Prototype / Idea

A compact telematics device collects real-time data from vehicles and assets.

A cloud-based platform processes and visualizes information for administrators.

Dashboards display live maps, alerts, and predictive analytics for proactive decision-making.

The solution ensures incident prevention, rapid response, and long-term reusability.
